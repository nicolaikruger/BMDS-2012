CLIENT:
The client bears the mark of a test implementation.
It not really usefull for other classes, as its methods wont return anything useful.
It simply provides methods for trying out each of the server commands.

SERVER:
The server waits for connections, and excecutes the requested tasks.
In its current state, the server has very poor consistancy checks (if any).
the server provides no means to manager users. This was not specified in the assignment.

ERATA:
The servers GET command does not take a user id, as these are hardly used throughout the program (and where not used in the example XML file).
Instead it takes a User object, and uses its name to validate against tasks. (a task doesnt contain user ids anyway).

The project as a whole is not very robust, and will fail on several trivial forms of errors.
We feel that this is okay, as the assignment seems to primarily concern network related issues, and not java error handling.
